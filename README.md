# React Weather Application
A weather application that communicates with a weather API to display the weather for the current day and the next four days after. Works with real time data and updates dynamically depending on user input. If you type in "Paris" for example you will get all the current weather results for Paris. You can also type in a post code or city or country as the API does a text search.

Made with React and Vite. Used styled components for CSS.
